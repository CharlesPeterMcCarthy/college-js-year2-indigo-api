# Second Year Client-Side-Scripting Assignment API

This is a PHP API used to communicate with the Spotify API. It requests an access token from Spotify which is returned to the program that called this API.

It uses a pre-built [PHP Spotify API wrapper](https://github.com/jwilsson/spotify-web-api-php).

### To Setup:

- Replace `{{CLIENT_ID}}` with your Spotify developer Client ID
- Replace `{{CLIENT_SECRET_ID}}` with your Spotify developer Client Secret ID
- Deploy to a server
